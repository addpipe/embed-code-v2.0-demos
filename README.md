# Using The JS Control and Events APIs with the 2.0 Embed Code from Pipe

The new [2.0 embed code](https://addpipe.com/blog/new-pipe-embed-code-v2-0-is-released-in-beta/) for the [Pipe video recording platform](https://addpipe.com) contains 2 ways to embed the Pipe video recorder client:

1. the HTML embed code (for conventional web pages and websites)
2. the JS embed code (for JS heavy single page web apps built with Node, Vue, Angular, etc.)

The code in this repository shows you how to use the JS [events](https://addpipe.com/docs#javascript-events-api) and [control APIs](https://addpipe.com/docs#javascript-control-api) with each of the 2 embed codes.
